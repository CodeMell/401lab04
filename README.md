## Summary
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. This program allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend on the command line.
